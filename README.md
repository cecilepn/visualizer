# School project - IUT 2025

Project designed as part of the Interactive Devices course at the IUT of Champs-sur-Marne.

Exploration and use of three.js, GSAP, React, and the Web Audio API.

# Good to know

When you click on "Character", you'll see different animations depending on the song's genre — or sometimes the artist. Try searching for Michael Jackson (bonus: Thriller) or Beyoncé!

More dancing animations are coming soon — stay tuned for future updates!
